Original OS repo: https://github.com/yhzhang0128/egos-2000
# Project Description
Our team upgraded an operating system in C. We made a threading and semaphore package, multi level feedback queue to schedule processes, a file write-through and write-back cache using the Clock eviction algorithm, and we also implemented the FAT file system. These upgrades increased the speed of the OS by 30%.
