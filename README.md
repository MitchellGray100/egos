## Disclaimer
We sadly can't upload any source code since the project was for a class project which would lead to an academic integrity violation; however, source code can be requested by job recruiters!

## Project Description
Our team upgraded an operating system in C. We made a threading and semaphore package, multi level feedback queue to schedule processes, a file write-through and write-back cache using the Clock eviction algorithm, and the FAT file system. These upgrades increased the speed of the OS by >30%.
